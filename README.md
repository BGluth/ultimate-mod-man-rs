# Ultimate Mod Manager
A mod manager written in Rust that aims to make managing mods for SSBU much less painful.

## Focus

The two core features that this tool aims to do well are:
- Mod conflict resolution.
- Automatic checking for updates of installed mods.

Once this is done, more features may be added.

## Limitations

- For the time being, this mod manager will only work for skins.
- Also at the start, this mod manager will only be CLI based. If there's interest, a GUI can be added on top later.
