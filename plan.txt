High-level UX:
- The user should be able to give a URL/ID (for now) to add to the mod collection
- The user should be able to enable/disable mods.
- From the CLI, the user should be able to give 1..* inputs of mods to add
    - The process downloads all mods and then exits.
- If there is a conflict from adding a mod, this does not stop the tool from adding the mod. Instead, the user is warned and must resolve conflicts later.
- If there are no conflicts, the user can update the (Acropolis) mods on the Switch. If there are conflicts, the tool applies all mods that are not in a conflict state (but still notifies the user).
- The resolve conflict tool:
    - Displays all conflicts for all slots.
    - Displays aggregated info first (eg. number of conflicts, names of mods with conflicts).
    - Goes through each slot with a conflict and offers the user a way to resolve it:
        - Finds all slots that are not offered taken by any other mods.
        - Lets the user pick a slot that is available.
        - If not slots are available, notifies the user.
        - If the other mod(s) in question are able to be resolved, these are then displayed to the user.

Commands:
- Status:
    - Displays the current state of installed mods.
    - Is the default when no command is specified.
- Add:
    - Takes in a list of URLs/IDs from stdin.
    - Downloads/processes these mods and quits when done.
    - (OPTIONAL) Also provide a way for the user to install a specific version.
- Resolve:
    - Opens the interactive resolve dialog and allows the user to resolve any active conflicts.
- Remove:
    - Removes the list of mods (IDs/Names) that are installed.
- Enable/Disable:
    - Sets the state of a list of mods (IDs/Names) to all be enabled/disabled.
- Switch update (Or a better name):
    - Given a path to the Acropolis directory on a Switch (automatic maybe?), update the mods on the Switch
- Switch compare:
    - Compares the manager's installed mods to what's on the Switch.
    - Notes unknown mods on the Switch.
    - Notes version discrepancies between the Switch and the mod manager.
- Check for updates:
    - Query the mods on GameBanana and move to an updated version if possible.
    - Only compares against mod manager state.
- Clean cache:
    - Removes all downloaded mods from the cache.

Internal details:
- Persistent state:
    - State is broken down into the following:
        - Installed mods (TOML?):
            - Contains the list of mods "installed" and associated data.
            - Data includes:
                - Slot overrides (from conflict resolution)
                - ID
                - Name
                - Version
                - Enabled
                - etc.
        - Cached mods:
            - When a mod is installed, it also gets an entry in the cache.
            - Cached mods are stored in their expanded format on disk (is there a reason to keep them compressed?).
    - State is either stored in the path that is given at the cmd line or uses a default dir given by the OS.
- Conflict detection:
    - All of the (relevant) files in each mod are assigned a slot.
    - To keep things simple, while it's possible that two mods might update something in the same slot but otherwise don't overwrite files, this is still considered a conflict.
    - A mod may install into multiple slots on multiple characters.
        - From this, mods have a 1..* slot & character association.
        - During conflict resolution, these individual `(char, slot)` tuples may be individually swapped with other free slots for a given character.
    - Slot overrides are simply a map from (`old_slot` --> `new_slot`) for a given character.
    - To keep things as generic as possible (to allow things like custom chars):
        - The prefix from the slot directory is the key used to check for conflicts.
- Switch Installation:
    - For this:
        - First scan to make sure all installed mods are cached and download if needed.
        - Next scan all installed mods in Acropolis and check the mod directory hashes.
        - For each hash that is different, update the version on the Switch (and print info to the user).
        - Apply any slot overrides for any mods (just rename the directories according to the map).
